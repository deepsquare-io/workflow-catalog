Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ We are excited that you want to contribute a new workflow to this repository. By doing this, you are helping people get up and running with DeepSquare, and that's awesome! ðŸ˜Ž

Contributions to this project are released to the public under the project's open-source license.

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

At this time, we are only accepting new starter workflows for Code Scanning.

Previous guidelines for new starter workflows:
Before merging a new workflow, the following requirements need to be met:

- The workflow should be as simple as needed for the service.
- There are many programming languages and tools out there. Right now, we don't have a page that allows for a really large number of workflows, so we do have to be a little choosy about what we accept. Less popular tools or languages might not be accepted.
- Automation and CI workflows should not send data to any 3rd-party service except for the purposes of installing dependencies.
- Automation and CI workflows cannot be dependent on a paid service or product.
- We require that workflows outside of the deepsquare-io organization be pinned to a specific SHA.

Thank you!
