# JupyterLab

JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

## Usage

Submit the `jupyterlab.yaml` by using a DeepSquare client (CLI or website). The
workflow will output a bore URL in the logs. Use that URL to log in to the desktop. You should also fetch the token which is also in the logs.
